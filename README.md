# Dynamic and Flexible auto width VML Button Generator !
Another VML padding based CTA link generator

See a working example on my [codepen](https://codepen.io/matthieuSolente/pen/BaqpxLR)

The idea for this generator came to me while analyzing the buttons created in BEE editor. The idea is to start from the padding to dynamically generate the width and height of the vml v:roundrect, for a pixel perfect CTA link !
